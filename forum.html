     "I’ve been with my husband just over 7 years, married for 4 years. He is a recovering drug addict/alcoholic. We met and married after he was clean and sober for about 5 years. He started to change in his behaviors and has become more self absorbed and less concerned with family life. We’ve had more arguments than ever. I mentioned to him a few times that I was worried, but he always put my worries to rest. Last weekend he became agitated over what seemed like something small. He started calling me horrible names, I got upset and defensive. I did grab his shoulders during our argument and in turn he pushed me away. I landed hard onto our living room floor. I wish things would’ve stopped there, but they didn’t . He then lost complete control and threw me in a chair, grabbed me by the face, jaw, and neck repeatedly. He was so angry. I tried to leave but he did not allow that and it only made him angrier. After it was all over, he we crying and said he felt awful. I ended up with a large bruise on my wrist, swollen lip, and cheek. Most of my face was sore including my nose. I also had a 1 inch long cut next to my nose. I am pretty shaken by the whole thing and can’t seem to get passed it. He is now telling me that if I wouldn’t have freaked out on him it would’ve never happened. It’s amazing how one incident can change 7 years just like that. Feeling sad, confused, and alone."

    "My journey to hell and back began twelve years ago. I married an abusive man who had a severe drinking problem. We had our good times but once we were married, his desire to control everything became more obvious. It got to a stage where I didn’t know what the truth was and what was a lie. I felt like a dog on a chain and I couldn’t get off it. The more I stayed with him the more it destroyed my self esteem. I began to believe that it was my fault and felt like I was in this rollercoaster that I couldn’t get off. I told him to stop but he wouldn’t, and I pushed him away but he pushed me back.  When his violence became much worse and was being directed at the children, I changed. I look in the eyes of my baby girl and know that she watched every bit. It helped to be able to see the truth. Now I stand up to him when he gives orders."

      "My wife and I are currently going through a divorce. She came home, more than likely drunk, and began verbally abusing me with not so classy language. Told me to leave, not that nicely, I said no. She proceeded to physically pull the pillows from under my head with all strength, I had one locked under my arm which she ended up pulling me to the floor with it. I got up, laid back down in bed and she then got on top of me to smother me (honestly think it was to make me uncomfortable so I’d get up). I told her this was nice and patted her back and said I missed her (I didn’t know what to do other than make her feel uncomfortable to get off me.) She didn’t, so I rolled her off me to my left side. She started to feign that I shoved her, with great force then ran to my 5 year old son’s room. Fearing for his safety, I followed and attempted to push the door open. I never gained entry before I heard her screaming that I was choking her over and over. I immediately called the police and went outside to wait. Cops came, already separated they began their questioning. I told my side and the other cop came down and said she admitted that I never touched her. They said no crime was committed, gave some advice on being in different homes until the divorce and left…I was so relieved that she didn’t seriously go off the deep-end and self-inflict wounds to have me hauled off in handcuffs that I was happy I wasn’t being taken away in handcuffs to even think…WHAT? I called, why didn’t they ask me if I wanted to press charges?"

  "I’m 39 years old. My older brother David, 59 years old, has been abusive all my life. My parents never did anything about him. Brothers and sisters just fight. He’s 20 years older than me. When I was a kid he was an adult. He has knocked several teeth out when I was a minor. After mom died last year, he has gotten more and more violent. In April our brother’s doctor called me with questions on our way to the hospital. While I was talking, to the doctor, David hit me up the face with his laptop. Broke some more teeth and came a hair from breaking my nose. I bit through my upper lip. Police came. He threatened to kill me in front of them (they had body cams). I sent the victims advocate my order of protection paperwork, medical bills, etc. Was notified today that he was only getting 2 years probation. No jail time at all. She said, “The next time he hits you, just me know”. He’s been doing this for 39 years! He’s always getting a slap on the wrist with a “don’t do it anymore”. What does it take to lock him up? He’s physically abusive to our father and his mother in law. They are both in their late 80s. Dad won’t do anything about him. His mother in law has an order of protection on him too."
