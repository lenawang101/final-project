      What are my rights?
    </h4>
    <p class="a">
      You have the right to be free from all forms of abuse in your relationships. In many states, abuse is a crime. Also, many states give the victim the right to file a case in court to stop abuse from a romantic partner or an ex-partner. However, you do not have to contact the police or go to court to get help. You also have the right to get protection from your school under a country-wide law called Title IX (Title 9).

      What can I do to protect myself?
    </h4>
    <p class="a">
      Protection orders are a powerful tool that can help you safely leave an abusive relationship. A protection order (sometimes called a restraining order) is a court order restricting an abuser’s movements and activities in relation to the victim. A protection order will protect the victim from having to come into contact with the abuser by prohibiting the abuser from stalking, harassing, communicating, or coming anywhere near the victim. If the abuser violates the order, they can face criminal penalties including jail time.

      I think my friend is trapped in this situation. How can I help them?
    </h4>
    <p class="a">
      First off, know that approaching a friend about an abusive relationship may be difficult. You might have already tried to talk to your friend and it may seem like they don’t listen or want to hear it. Know that while your friend is in the abusive relationship, they may not recognize the warning signs of abuse like you have. When talking to your friend or if your friend approaches you with concerns, be supportive. Don’t judge them, keep an open mind and help them get the resources they need like creating a safety plan. Let them know you have noticed certain things that concern you. Ask them if they have noticed the same and how that behavior makes them feel. If you feel that your friend is in immediate danger or that their life is at risk or has been threatened, you may want to get emergency support by calling 911. It may not be your first choice for help, but if things are serious it’s important to call professionals for support. You may also consider talking to a counselor, trusted adult, or legal aid if there is no immediate danger present.

      I am afraid of being judged if I speak out about my situation, as I am a male or of a non-binary gender, which makes it difficult to admit my abuse.
    </h4> 
    <p class="a">
      If you’re a man in an abusive relationship, it’s important to know that you’re not alone. It happens to men from all cultures and all walks of life regardless of age, occupation, or sexual orientation. Figures suggest that as many as one in three victims of domestic violence are male. However, men are often reluctant to report abuse because they feel embarrassed, fear they won’t be believed, or are scared that their partner will take revenge.Admitting the problem and seeking help doesn’t mean you have failed as a man or as a husband. You are not to blame, and you are not weak. As well as offering a sense of relief and providing some much-needed support, sharing details of your abuse can also be the first step in building a case against your abuser. Leave if possible and obtain evidence of the abuse. Seek guidance and support from the variety of organizations listed on the links page.
